libnabo provides a clean, legacy-free, scalar-type–agnostic API thanks to C++ templates.
Its current CPU implementation is strongly inspired by [ANN], but with more compact data types. On the average, libnabo is 5% to 20% faster than [ANN].

**Dependencies:**
- libnabo depends on [Eigen], a modern C++ matrix and linear-algebra library.
- libnabo works with either version 2 or 3 of Eigen.
- libnabo also optionally depends on [Boost], a C++ general library, for Python bindings.

**Credit:** 
- libnabo was developed by [Stéphane Magnenat](http://stephane.magnenat.net) as part of his work at [ASL-ETH](http://www.asl.ethz.ch)
- libnabo is now maintained by [NorLab](https://github.com/norlab-ulaval)


If you are interested in a pure-[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) version, check [that repository](https://github.com/enlightware/nabo-rs) out.

[//]: # (====Release note=========================================================================)

### ★ Version `1.1.0` Release Note 

This release of _libnabo_ introduces the integration
of [norlab-build-system (NBS)](https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/norlab-build-system) as a _git
submodule_ for codebase development and testing.

Execute the following to clone the repository with its submodule:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/libnabo.git
```

If _libnabo_ was previously cloned, execute the following to fetch its new submodule

```shell
git submodule update --remote --recursive --init
```

### ★ Contributing Instructions

See [contributing_instructions.md](contributing/contributing_instructions.md)
for instructions related to bug reporting, code contribution and for setting up
the `libnabo-build-system`
on your workstation to speed up your local development workflow.

---
Docker images 
========
Run the following commands to pull and run libnabo in a docker container 
```shell
docker pull norlabulaval/libnabo:latest-ubuntu-focal

docker run -it --rm norlabulaval/libnabo:latest-ubuntu-focal
```
See available [libnabo image tags](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/norlabulaval/libnabo/) on dockerhub.

To install docker related dependencies on ubuntu, execute the following

```shell
cd ./build_system/nabo_utility_script

# Execute docker tools install script i.e. docker daemon, docker compose, docker buildx
bash nabo_install_docker_tools.bash
```

Compilation
===========

For conveniences, you can use the provided build script for Unix
```shell
bash libnabo_dependencies_installer.bash

# Use the --help flag to see the list of optional flag
bash libnabo_installer.bash [<optional flag>]
```
If you want more control, you can follow these commands:
```shell
SRC_DIR=`pwd`
BUILD_DIR=${SRC_DIR}/build
mkdir -p ${BUILD_DIR} && cd ${BUILD_DIR}
cmake ${SRC_DIR}
cmake --build ${BUILD_DIR}
sudo cmake --build ${BUILD_DIR} --target install
```
These lines will compile libnabo in a `build` sub-directory and install it system-wide.

To uninstall libnabo, simply run `sudo make uninstall` from your build directory.

### Compilation options

libnabo provides the following compilation options, available through [CMake]:

 * `SHARED_LIBS` (boolean, default: `false`): if `true`, build a shared library, otherwise build a static library

### Documentation

You can generate the documentation by typing:

	make doc

Prerequisites
-------------

If your operating system does not provide it, you must get [Eigen], and [Boost] if you want to build the Python bindings.
[Eigen] only needs to be downloaded and extracted.

Add libnabo to your CMake project
---------------------------------------------
```cmake
find_package(libnabo REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(example PUBLIC ${libnabo_LIBRARIES})
target_include_directories(example PUBLIC ${libnabo_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```

Usage
=====

libnabo is easy to use. For example, assuming that you are working with floats and that you have a point set `M` and a query point `q`, you can find the `K` nearest neighbours of `q` in `M`:

	#include "nabo/nabo.h"
	using namespace Nabo;
	using namespace Eigen;
	...
	NNSearchF* nns = NNSearchF::createKDTreeLinearHeap(M);

	const int K = 5;
	VectorXi indices(K);
	VectorXf dists2(K);

	nns->knn(q, indices, dists2, K);

In this example, `M` is an [Eigen] (refering to the software, not to the math) matrix (column major, float) and `q` is an [Eigen] vector (float). Note that `M` **must stay alive** throughout the use of libnabo, otherwise the results of `knn` are undefined.
The results `indices` and `dists2` are [Eigen] vectors of indices and squared distances refering to the columns of `M`.
See `examples/trivial.cpp` for a compilable version of this example, and `examples/usage.cpp` for a slightly more complex example involving multi-point queries.

Running `make doc` in your build directory will generate a browsable documentation in `doc/html`.
The main page `doc/html/index.html` contains a detailed overview of the usage of libnabo.

You can find a complete CMake integration
example in [examples/libnabo-cmake-example](examples/libnabo-cmake-example) to
see how to look for, and link against this library.

Python bindings
===============

libnabo includes python bindings that are compiled if Python is available.
The resulting module is called pynabo, you can see an example in `python/test.py`.
You can find more information in the docstring-based documentation:

	python -c "import pynabo; help(pynabo.NearestNeighbourSearch)"

Building
--------

The Python bindings can be generated for Python 2 or Python 3.
To specify the version of the interpreter to use when building the bindings, set the `PYTHON_VERSION_MAJOR` and `PYTHON_VERSION_MINOR` variables.
For example if you have both Python 2.7 and 3.5 installed, you could ask CMake to generate Python 3 bindings by using the following command.

    cmake -DPYTHON_VERSION_MAJOR=3 -DPYTHON_VERSION_MINOR=5 ..

On Debian-based distributions you may also need the `-DPYTHON_DEB_INSTALL_TARGET` option enabled.

Unit testing
============

The distribution of libnabo integrates a unit test module, based on CTest.
Just type:

	make test

...in the build directory to run the tests.
Their outputs are available in the `Testing` directory.
These consist of validation and benchmarking tests.
If [ANN] or [FLANN] are detected when compiling libnabo, `make test` will also perform comparative benchmarks.
