#
# GitHub action for executing "semantic-release" with configuration in ".releaserc.json"
#
# Note about pushing to protected branches:
#
#   The GITHUB_TOKEN credential does not have the required permission
#   to operate on protected branches.
#   Solution:
#    1. generate a GitHub Personal Access Token
#    2. and register it as a Repository Secrets and name it `SEMANTIC_RELEASE_GH_TOKEN`
#    3. Important: set "actions/checkout" to "persist-credentials: false" otherwise it will be overwriten
